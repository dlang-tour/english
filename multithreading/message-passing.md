# Message Passing

Instead of dealing with threads and doing synchronization
yourself D allows to use *message passing* as a means
to leverage the power of multiple cores. Threads communicate
with *messages* - which are arbitrary values - to distribute
work and synchronize themselves. They don't share data
by design which avoids the common problems of
multi-threading.

All functions that implement message passing in D
can be found in the [`std.concurrency`](https://dlang.org/phobos/std_concurrency.html)
module. `spawn` creates a new *thread* based on a
user-defined function:

    auto threadId = spawn(&foo, thisTid);

`thisTid` is a `std.concurrency` built-in and references
the current thread which is needed for message passing. `spawn`
takes a function as first parameter and
additional parameters to that function as arguments.

    void foo(Tid parentTid) {
        receive(
          (int i) { writeln("An ", i, " was sent!"); }
        );
        
        send(parentTid, "Done");
    }

The `receive` function is like a `switch`-`case`
and dispatches the values it receives from other threads
to the passed `delegates` - depending on the received
value's type.

To send a message to a specific thread use the function `send`
and its id:

    send(threadId, 42);

`receiveOnly` can be used to just receive a specified
type:

    string text = receiveOnly!string();
    assert(text == "Done");

The `receive` family functions block until something
has been sent to the thread's mailbox.
