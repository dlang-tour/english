# Synchronization & Sharing

Although the preferred way in D to do multi-threading
is to rely on `immutable` data and synchronize threads
using message passing, the language has built-in
support for *synchronization* primitives as well as
type system support with `shared` to mark objects
that are accessed from multiple threads.

The `shared` type identifier allows to mark variables
that are shared among different threads:

    shared(int)* p = new int;
    int* t = p; // ERROR

For example `std.concurrency.send` just allows to send either
`immutable` or `shared` data and copying the message
to be sent. `shared` is transitive so if a `class` or `struct`
is marked `shared` all its members will be too.
Note that `static` variables aren't `shared` by
default because they are implemented using
*thread local storage* (TLS) and each thread gets
its own variable.

`synchronized` blocks allow to instruct the compiler
to create  a critical section that can only be entered
by one thread at a time.

    synchronized {
        importStuff();
    }

Within `class` member functions these blocks might be
limited to different member objects *mutexes*
with `synchronized(member1, member2)` to reduce
contention. The D compiler inserts *critical
sections* automatically. A whole class can be marked
as `synchronized` as well and the compiler will
make sure that just one thread accesses a concrete
instance of it at a time.

Atomic operations on `shared` variables can be
performed using the `core.atomic.atomicOp`
helper:

    shared int test = 5;
    test.atomicOp!"+="(4);
