# Ranges

If a `foreach` is encountered by the compiler

```
foreach (element; range)
{
    // Loop body...
}
```

it's internally rewritten similar to the following:

```
for (auto __rangeCopy = range;
     !__rangeCopy.empty;
     __rangeCopy.popFront())
 {
    auto element = rangeCopy.front;
    // Loop body...
}
```

If the range object is a reference type (e.g. `class`), then the range will be
consumed and won't available for subsequent iteration (that is unless the
loop body breaks before the last loop iteration). If the range object is
a value type, then a copy of the range will be made and depending on the
way the range is defined the loop may or may not consume the original
range. Most of the ranges in the standard library are structs and so `foreach`
iteration is usually non-destructive, though not guaranteed. If this
guarantee is important, require **forward** ranges.

Any object which fulfills the above interface is called a **range**
and is thus a type that can be iterated over:

```
    struct Range
    {
        @property bool empty() const;
        void popFront();
        T front() const;
    }
 ```
Note that while it is customary for `empty` and `front` to be defined as `const`
functions (implying that calling them won't modify the range), this is not
required.

The functions in `std.range` and `std.algorithm` provide
building blocks that make use of this interface. Ranges allow us
to compose complex algorithms behind an object that
can be iterated with ease. Furthermore, ranges allow us to create **lazy**
objects that only perform a calculation when it's really needed
in an iteration e.g. when the next range's element is accessed.
Special range algorithms will be presented later in the
[D's Gems](gems/range-algorithms) section.

### Exercise

Complete the source code to create the `FibonacciRange` range
that returns numbers of the
[Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).
Don't fool yourself into deleting the `assert`ions!

## {SourceCode:incomplete}

```d
import std.stdio : writeln;

struct FibonacciRange
{
    bool empty() const @property
    {
        // So when does the Fibonacci sequence
        // end?!
    }

    void popFront()
    {
    }

    int front() @property
    {
    }
}

void main()
{
    import std.range : take;
    import std.array : array;

    FibonacciRange fib;

    // `take` creates another range which
    // will return N elements at maximum.
    // This range is _lazy_ and just
    // touches the original range
    // if actually needed
    auto fib10 = take(fib, 10);

    // But we do want to touch all elements and
    // convert the range to array of integers.
    int[] the10Fibs = array(fib10);

    writeln("The 10 first Fibonacci numbers: ",
        the10Fibs);
    assert(the10Fibs ==
        [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]);
}
```
