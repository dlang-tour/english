# Ranges

If a `foreach` is encountered by the compiler

    foreach(element; range) {

it's internally rewritten similar to the following:

    for (; !range.empty; range.popFront()) {
        auto element = range.front;
        ...

Any object which fulfills the above interface is called a **range**
and is thus a type that can be iterated over:

    struct Range {
        @property empty() const;
        void popFront();
        T front();
    }

The functions in `std.range` and `std.algorithm` provide
building blocks that make use of this interface. Ranges allow
to compose complex algorithms behind an object that
can be iterated with ease. Furthermore ranges allow to create **lazy**
objects that only perform a calculation when it's really needed
in an iteration e.g. when the next range's element is accessed.
Special range algorithm will be presented later in the
[D's Gems](gems/range-algorithms) section.

### Exercise

Complete the source code to create the `FibonacciRange` range
that returns numbers of the
[Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).
Don't fool yourself into deleting the `assert`ions!

## {SourceCode:incomplete}

```d
import std.stdio : writeln;

struct FibonacciRange
{
    bool empty() const @property
    {
        // So when does the Fibonacci sequence
        // end?!
    }

    void popFront()
    {
    }

    int front() @property
    {
    }
}

void main() {
    import std.range: take;
    import std.array: array;

    FibonacciRange fib;

    // `take` creates another range which
    // will return N elements at maximum.
    // This range is _lazy_ and just
    // touches the original range
    // if actually needed
    auto fib10 = take(fib, 10);

    // But we do want to touch all elements and
    // convert the range to array of integers.
    int[] the10Fibs = array(fib10);

    writeln("The 10 first Fibonacci numbers: ",
        the10Fibs);
    assert(the10Fibs ==
        [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]);
}
