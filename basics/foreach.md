# Foreach

D features a `foreach` loop which allows
less error-prone and better readable iterations.

### Element iteration

Given an array `arr` of type `int[]` it is possible to
iterate through the elements using a `foreach` loop:

    foreach (int e; arr) {
        writeln(e);
    }

The first field in the `foreach` definition is the variable
name used in the loop iteration. Its type is induced automatically:

    foreach (e; arr) {
        // typeof(e) is int
        writeln(e);
    }

The second field must be an array - or a special iterable
object called a **range** which will be introduced in the next section.

### Access by reference

Elements will be copied from the array or range during iteration.
This is acceptable for basic types, but might be a problem for
large types. To prevent copying or to enable *in-place
*mutation, `ref` can be used:

    foreach (ref e; arr) {
        e = 10; // overwrite value
    }

### Iterate `n` times

D allows to write iterations which should be executed
`n` times, more concisely with the `..` syntax:

    foreach (i; 0..3) {
        writeln(i);
    }
    // 0 1 2

The last number in `a..b`` is excluded from the range,
thus the loop body is executed `3` times.

### Iteration with index counter

For arrays, it's also possible to access a separate index variable.

    foreach (i, e; [4, 5, 6]) {
        writeln(i, ":", e);
    }
    // 0:4 1:5 2:6

### Reverse iteration with `foreach_reverse`

A collection can be iterated in reverse order with
`foreach_reverse`:

    foreach_reverse (e; [1, 2, 3]) {
        writeln(e);
    }
    // 3 2 1

## {SourceCode}

```d
import std.stdio : writefln;

void main() {
    auto arr = [
        [5, 15],      // 20
        [2, 3, 2, 3], // 10
        [3, 6, 2, 9], // 20
    ];

    foreach (i, row; arr)
    {
        double total = 0.0;
        foreach (e; row)
            total += e;

        auto avg = total / row.length;
        writefln("AVG [row=%d]: %.2f", i, avg);
    }
}
```
