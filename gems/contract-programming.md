# Contract programming

Contract programming in D includes a set of language constructs
that allow increasing the code quality by implementing
sanity checks that make sure that the code base
behaves as intended. Contracts are only available in
**debug** mode and won't be run in release mode.
Therefore they shouldn't be used to validate user input.

### `assert`

The simplest form of contract programming in D is
the `assert(...)` expression that checks that a certain
condition is met - and aborts the program with
an `AssertionError` otherwise.

    assert(sqrt(4) == 2);
    // optional custom assertion error message
    assert(sqrt(16) == 4, "sqrt is broken!");

### Function contracts

`in` and `out` allow to formalize contracts for input
parameters and return values of functions.

    long square_root(long x)
    in {
        assert(x >= 0);
    } out (result) {
        assert((result * result) <= x
            && (result+1) * (result+1) > x);
    } body {
        return cast(long)std.math.sqrt(cast(real)x);
    }

The content in the `in` block could also be expressed
within the function's body but the intent is much clearer
this way. In the `out` block the function's return
value can be captured with `out(result)` and
verified accordingly.

### Invariant checking

`invariant()` is a special member function of `struct`
and `class` types that allows sanity checking an object's
state during its whole lifetime:

* It's called after the constructor has run and before
  the destructor is called.
* It's called before entering a member function
* `invariant()` is called after exiting a member
  function.

### Validating user input

As all contracts will be removed in the release build, user input should not
be checked using contracts. Moreover `assert`s can still be used be in
`nothrow` functions, because they throw fatal `Errors`.
The runtime analog to `assert` is [`std.exception.enforce`](https://dlang.org/phobos/std_exception.html#.enforce),
which will throw catchable `Exceptions`.
